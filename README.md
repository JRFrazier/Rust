# Rust
All of my notes and projects from my Rust learning journey

## Instalation Linux/Mac OS
---
Run the following commands in order.

This command downloads a script and starts the installation of the rustup tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust:
```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Run the following to add Rust to your path:

```bash
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Run the following to update Rust to the latest version:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

Check ther version of Rust by running:

```bash
$ rustc --version
```

## General Notes
---

- Rust files always end with the .rs extension. If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename,use an underscore to separate them. For example, use hello_world.rs rather than helloworld.rs.

- The "main" function is the first line of code that will run in ever Rust program:
```rust
fn main() {}
```

> ## Note:
> ### Formatting Code
> Run the following command to format your code:
> ```bash
> $ rustfmt example.rs
> ```
